Ai: **Summary (based on the provided context)**  
Charlie Kirk is described as an American right‑wing activist who was fatally shot on September 10 2025 while addressing an audience at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The outdoor event was the first stop of the season for his Ameri…‑linked tour. His funeral was slated for September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with former President Donald Trump said to be attending. Utah prosecutors have identified a suspect, Tyler Robinson, who is being held without bail. The coverage also links Kirk to Turning Point‑sponsored events and mentions his alleged role in marginalizing commentator Michelle Malkin.
